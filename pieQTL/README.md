The code is for identifying the promoter interacting eQTLs (pieQTLs) from input eQTLs.

1. eQTLs are defined as SNPs within 1 Mb (conventional analysis) from their target eGenes.

2. pieQTLs are defined as the eQTLs overlapping cis-regulatory regions, and also having significant FitHiChIP interaction with their target eGenes.

In the script, user needs to check the first few lines (parameter section) and edit them according to the input files.
